('A cappella', 'Music performed a cappella, less commonly spelled acapella in English, is music performed by a singer or a singing group without instrumental accompaniment. The term a cappella was originally intended to differentiate between Renaissance polyphony and Baroque concertato musical styles.

The term is also used, rarely, as a synonym for alla breve.'),

Another defining characteristic of the style is the use of unconventional chords in some cases with complex progressions and \"ambiguous\" harmonies. A common misconception is that these complex chords and harmonies were derived from jazz, but samba guitar players have been using similar arrangement structures since the early 1920s, indicating a case of parallel evolution of styles rather than a simple transference from jazz to bossa nova. Nevertheless, bossa nova was influenced by jazz, both in the harmonies used and also by the instrumentation of songs, and today many bossa nova songs are considered jazz standards. The popularity of bossa nova has helped to renew samba and contributed to the modernization of Brazilian music in general.'),

In these cases the composition often began and ended on a unison, the added voice keeping to the initial tone until the first part has reached a fifth or fourth, from where both voices proceeded in parallel harmony, with the reverse process at the end. Organum was originally improvised; while one singer performed a notated melody, another singer—singing \"by ear\"—provided the unnotated second melody.

Pop/rock may be viewed as a continuous genre field rather than separate categories. The detractors of pop rock often deride it as a slick, commercial product and less authentic than rock music.'),
('Pop Sunda', 'Sundanese Music is an umbrella term that encompasses diverse musical traditions of the West Java and Banten in western part of Java, Indonesia. The term of \"West Java\" is preferred by scholars in this field.

In a way similar to the predecessor genres post-rock and post-hardcore, post-metal offsets the darkness and intensity of extreme metal with an emphasis on atmosphere, emotion, and even \"revelation\", developing an expansive but introspective sound variously imbued with elements of ambient, noise, psychedelic, progressive, and classical music, and often shoegaze and art rock. Songs are typically long, with loose and layered structures that discard the verse–chorus form in favor of crescendos and repeating themes. The sound centres on guitars and drums, while any vocals are often but not always screamed or growled and resemble an additional instrument.'),
('Post Punk', 'Post-punk is a broad genre of music that emerged in late 1977 in the wake of punk rock. The term was coined by Jon Savage in November 1977. Post-punk musicians departed from punk\'s fundamental elements and raw simplicity, instead adopting a broader, more experimental approach that encompassed a variety of avant-garde sensibilities and non-rock influences. Inspired by punk\'s energy and do it yourself ethic but determined to break from rock cliches, artists drew influence from Germany\'s krautrock scene and experimented with styles like funk, electronic music, jazz, and dance music; the production techniques of dub and disco; and ideas from art and politics, including modernist art, cinema and literature.

Additional elements contributed to its \"progressive\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \"art\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening rather than dancing.'),
